## Description
The Rule Engine Application is a flexible tool designed to evaluate user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, income, and spending. It allows users to create rules using logical expressions and assess whether specific user attributes meet those conditions.

## Features
- **Rule Creation** : Define rules using logical expressions (e.g., "age > 18 and income < 50000").
- **Attribute Evaluation** : Evaluate user attributes against defined rules to determine eligibility.
- **Customizable Logic** : Create rules based on different criteria, enhancing flexibility for various use cases.
- **Error Handling** : Basic error handling for invalid input or rule syntax errors.

## Installation
To install and run the Rule Engine Application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, we should have the following installed on our system:

1. **Python 3.x**: Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **pip**: This is the package installer for Python.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: cd rule_engine

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify Installation:
python app.py

# Usage:
**Create a Rule**
  from rules import create_rule

# Create a new rule
rule = create_rule("age > 18 and income < 50000")

**Evaluate a Rule**
from rules import evaluate_rule

# Define user attributes
user_attributes = {
    'age': 20,
    'income': 30000,
    'department': 'Finance',
    'spend': 1000
}

# Evaluate the rule
result = evaluate_rule(user_attributes)

print("Eligibility:", result)  # Output: Eligibility: True or False

# Testing:
  pytest tests/

# Security Measures:
**Input Validation** : The application performs validation on user inputs to prevent invalid data entry.
**Data Protection** : Sensitive information is handled securely, and proper authentication should be considered if this application is used in a web environment.

# Performance Optimizations:
**Efficient Rule Evaluation** : The rule engine is optimized for quick evaluations by using efficient algorithms to parse and assess rules against user attributes.
**Caching** : Frequently evaluated rules can be cached to improve performance during repeated assessments.
